There are multiple versions of the C programming language each named after the year they were finalized. The available versions are C89, C99, C11, and C23.

The main difference between C89 and C99 is a lot of syntax changes and especially how types are managed. Types in C99 are declared in a standard library that has consistent typing unlike C89. C99 also includes features such as key-value mapping for structs, local variable declaration, and of course the C standard library.

I will have to do more research on both C11 and C23.
